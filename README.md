# CleanReddit

CleanReddit is a lightweight Userscript that transforms Reddit into a distraction-free environment. It removes the algorithmic feed on the homepage, hides promoted posts and ads, cleans up sidebars, and centers the content for a focused browsing experience.

## Features

- **Minimalist Homepage**: Replaces the chaotic feed with a clean, centered search bar and Reddit logo – just like Google Search.
- **Sidebar-Free Layout**: Removes the left navigation drawer and right sidebar for a distraction-free, full-width reading experience.
- **Clean Search Results**: Displays search results without clutter, removing sidebars and unnecessary UI elements.

## Installation

Since this is a specific Userscript, you need a Userscript manager for your browser.

1. Install the **Tampermonkey** browser extension (available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
2. **[Click here to install the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukas-hzb/CleanReddit/main/clean_reddit.user.js)**.
3. Tampermonkey will ask if you want to add the script. Confirm by clicking "Install".
4. Open Reddit – the clean interface should appear automatically.

## Works Best With

This script focuses on layout cleanup. For a complete distraction-free experience, I recommend pairing it with:

- **[AdGuard AdBlocker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adguard-adblocker/bgnkhhnnamicmpeenaelnjfhikgbkllg)** - Blocks ads and trackers.
- **[AdGuard Extra](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adguard-extra/mglnbgkhalffomgekihjhhldamhhlcmp)** - Bypasses anti-adblock scripts and removes residual ads.
- **[SocialFocus — Hide Feeds](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/socialfocus-%E2%80%94-hide-feeds/abocjojdmemdpiffeadpdnicnlhcndcg?hl=en-US)** - Hides Shorts, recommendations, and other distractions.
